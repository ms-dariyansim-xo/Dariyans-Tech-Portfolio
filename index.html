        <h3>CRAPS! I chose craps.</h3>
        <em>Wed., June 1st 2022</em>
            <p>After reviewing the three project options of GUI portion of assignment, 
                I chose CRAPS project. I find it ironic considering that I don't parttake in "gambling", not necessarily because I'm against it, 
                I have the worst luck when it comes to betting anything. HA!</p>
            <p>But I'm always up for a challenge and wanted to take advantage of my creativity.
                Solely based on what I can remember (design-wise on general slot machines or table games)
                and what I'd prefer to see in terms of understanding it without ever playing it before. 
                While I'm skimming through the "How to Play Casino Craps for Beginners" blog provided by the professor, 
                I'm refraining from searching for images (for the sake of creativity and originality, LOL).</p>
            <p>I already have an idea how I'd go about it.
                I'm going to quickly draft my ideas, then I'll get the repository going and all that jive. </p>
                 <sub> Main window (richtextbox) should be the PLAYING AREA: Round level, encouraging messages, dices and results. 
                    Sectioned next to main window (groupbox) with increase/decrease buttons, roll, reset.
                    Second window (richtextbox) to track win/lose results. Maybe with balance and points.
                    or label style to display balance and points.</sub>
               
                
                
            <p>And while I'm typing all of these out, I'm well aware that I'll be developing GUIs in HTML and CSS with a bit of JavaScript, 
                I used the C# form terms just to give myself a vision without actual painting. That said, I got the repo up and running, I figured now would be the time to do lecture reviews for some great re-freshers.                 
            <p>Speaking of refresher, a boost of afternoon caffeine couldn't do harm with my creativity juice.</p>
            Woot! Let's go!</p>

            <h3>What the 'script'?!</h3>
            <em>Thurs., June 2nd 2022</em>
            <p>I spent some time reviewing lectures to touch on the basics of JavaScript 
                and my mind doesn't seem to register the 'script src' concept each and every time. </p>
                
                <p>Until I realized that I consistently missed on adding the alert(); because I had used it interchangeably 
                with another method script without citing the "source". </p>

                <img src="/images/dwight1.gif" width="300px">
                <p>Once I had that figured out, I took a dig into JavaScript operators to ensure 
                    I understood when and why to use "===" and/or "==" both in C# AND JavaScript. 
                    I need to get comfortable with these concepts as I'm developing some design ideas for 
                    CRAPS project. Or any other developments.</p>
                <p>As far as the front-end, there's a few things I need to add onto what I've started since Wednesday:</p>
                <sub>I will need to utilize TABLES to sort out the BUTTON (organized layout).
                Contents should be layered in mininum of two DIVS;
                First DIV: HERO-IMAGE with CRAPS' rules above a container that holds the playing area.
                Second DIV: PLAYING area with GRID-Template, rows and columns still being determined.</sub>
                <p>I'll figure out the colors. Initially thought of emerald green and gold accents, 
                    but that will be taken care of towards the finalization steps.
                </p>

            <h3>Lay it out, layout! </h3>
            <em>Sat., June 4th 2022</em>
            <p>I followed with the ideas I had a couple days back and this is just about 10 minutes in, very basic but so far so good! I got the DIVs in like I intended, made some adjustments on the location and I'm going to use some of the <dl> tags in the game rules. Initially had envisioned a hero-image and decided to go with a similar concept but another DIV, so I can better control sectionally as far as styling goes.</p>
            
                <iframe src="craps_project.html" width="400px" height="300px"></iframe>

                <p>Ideas updated: Read over the rules of the game once again and figured
                    it's simple but not simple. I'm not going to think too much into it,
                as I'm feeling pretty confident it'll look how I envisioned. (I'm a perfectionist, my work will be my best work and ALWAYS a WIP.) </p>
                <p>Note to self: Get on with these MEDIA QUERIESSSS.</p>

            <h3>Can't use the < form > elements without the FORM tag!</h3>
            <em>Sun., June 5th 2022</em>
            <p>Alright, first things first-- I forgot that the iFrames I previously 
                added into yesterday's blog is a live-time display, luckily I had taken a screenshot
                of the original layout I spent that "10 minutes" on. ;) Anyway, I'll keep the 
                iFrames and add the screenshot while I'm at it.
                </p>
                <p>That said, back to the topic-- I'm still testing this theory, whether form elements can't be
                    used without using the form tag, as with many other hiccups
                    along the way. I made it as far as adding GRID into nested DIV ids and classes, 
                    as I knew I needed more practice on these concepts.
                    Ironically, I stumbled upon an issue with getting the columns utilizing classes.
                    What it seems to me is working with IDs are much easier to manipulate, in terms of
                    sectioned layouts. 
                </p>
                <p>I'm having a slight brain-fog from all these changes and discoveries,
                    but it's entertaining. And somewhat therapuetic. 
                </p>
                <p>I'm positive that you CAN use the FORM elements OUTSIDE of the form tag.</p>
                <p>I used Descriptive Lists to achieve what I could've done with Ordered Lists. HAHAHAH.</p>

            <h3>Forms, Input Types, Output Tags..</h3>
            <em>Mon., June 6th 2022</em>
            <p>When I started working on GUIs for Craps game project, I had it in the back of my mind
              that I would need to utilize FORM tags, with all the other elements necessary. I had to ensure
              I wasn't investing "too much" time into placing appropriate ones, by "substituting" them with mainly 
              P tags. Right now, the utilization of OUTPUT element and everything about "math" are seemingly 
              complicated: this calls for a review through repos made from Front-End Web class lectures.
            </p>
            
            <p>I didn't have the need to use Tables like I thought I would. That gives me extra time
                to review my syntaxes so far, eliminate some of the P tags with actual 
                Input Type elements (wherever I think is applicable).
            </p>
            <p>Pretty confident I will get the JavaScript functionality sorted out, but it's obviously
                something I need to be mindful when developing this project -- so they can be wired up
                with less headaches, simply because they've been prepped for the second part
                of the development... Those darn JS Scripts.

            <h3>Drafted on Word to organize my thoughts.</h3>
            <p><b>“Sometimes an uncomfortable feeling or situation is needed to find the right direction.” -Dariyan Sim</b></p>
            <p> TOPIC: 
                Introduction to my multi-dimensional creative ideas for my personal and education/major-related projects and how I’d branch out from individual creation!
                SUMMARY/KEY NOTES: 
                Type of projects, what skills will shine, why/reasons behind these projects and where/how they will be promoted.
                CONTENT:
                As for my personal projects, it’s been long overdue for my stories to be told! I cannot stress enough how many times I have drafted my chapters in varying written forms, from jotting down topic ideas or subjects in a notepad, to scribbling out some changes repeatedly on my Word document, before I temporarily “gave up”-- in order to allow myself a mental reset. So, I could try again with a new plan no matter how long it took. 
                I have a great sense of self-awareness and of my surroundings, and can be my worst critic—but currently, I am in a place where my creativity is no longer restricted (regardless of the restriction being self-inflicted or not). I knew I wouldn’t have been able to give it my best shot, if I was under some sort of pressure being rushed or forcing on my contents—
                it just wouldn’t feel authentic. Authentically me. One of the current courses I’m enrolled in has sparked a great deal of inspiration. An inspiration to develop my own platform to display skill sets and get my stories out. (I enjoy all the courses I’ve taken). 
                While I have no issues with self-expression, showcasing my skills, or simply talking about life in general—I’m particular about my work for a reason, any type of work or passion, for many reasons matter of fact. 
                The ability to compile a plan or strategy, as one of the first steps in preparation is great and all, yet still having an open mind that things may not always go as planned, is something I’ve learned throughout my struggles of “explaining who I am”. To avoid being harsh on myself, I decided to take the time to focus one thing at a time, work on my craft with confident and enjoying those moments as well. Enjoying moments, including when mistakes are made, because if I’m passionate about something, I should be consistent. 
               
                One of my main PERSONAL projects that I plan to bring to the table is my “mini-TV series”, with a title in acronym called “HWTH”: written, directed and performed by me. (In current development, title is concealed until I have a full understanding of copyrights with my potential brand-name). “HWTH” is a three-part project that utilizes all three of my ALTER EGOS: deaf side, hard-of-hearing and hearing side of Dariyan. Options to showcase these visuals would be using YouTube and Instagram platforms, which brings to the next subject later in this content.</p>
